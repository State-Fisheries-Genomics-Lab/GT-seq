# GT-seq
Standard Operating Procedure, Scripts, and data for GT-seq Genotyping

Repository Contents:

<b>(1) Example Protocol:</b> Full genotyping pipeline from raw sequence reads to fully filtered SNP dataset in multiple formats. Download and open GT-seq_SOP.html in a browser to view. To run for yourself the easiest path is to clone this full repository to your local machine.  
<b>(2) Example Data:</b> data to run the example protocol/SOP  
<b>(3) Probe Sequences</b> Data needed to run pipeline    
<b>(4) GT-seq Scripts:</b> Updated repository of GTseq pipeline scripts  
<b>(5) Panel Info:</b> Information about markers such as primer sequences, source, annotation etc  
<b>(6) Panel Mapping:</b> Results from mapping GTseq marker amplicons against reference genomes  
<b>(7) Primer Pools:</b> Different pools of primers are sometimes used across runs and are indicated in illumina run summary documents. These list the markers used in the pools.
