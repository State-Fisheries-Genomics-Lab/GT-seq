GTseq-Pipeline
==============

These are directly copied from https://github.com/GTseq/GTseq-Pipeline, with the exception of the v3.1 genotyper script which has been updated to fix a bug.


From the GTseq readme:
A series of perl and python scripts for generating genotypes from NGS fastq files from GTseq libraries. 

Recommend using version 3 "v3" scripts for genotyping.  These allow for faster computing and better graphical output.
